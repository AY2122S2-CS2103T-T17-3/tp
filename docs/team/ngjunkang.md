### Project: Automated Insurance Assistant (AIA)

Automated Insurance Assistant (AIA) is a desktop application for managing contacts. AIA helps insurance agents handle all contact management processes, making sure they always have a snapshot of clientsâ€™ profiles on hand, with reminders for events.
