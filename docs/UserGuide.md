Automated Insurance Assistant (AIA) is a desktop application that helps Insurance Agents to manage their client contacts.
Instead of hiring a secretary to handle day-to-day activities, using AIA can help you achieve the following:
- Catalogue and easily retrieve saved data on clients based on specific categories
- Keep track of important events and time sensitive tasks to do for each client (e.g. client birthdays)
- Keep records of previous interactions with each client

Usage of this application is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still displaying information to users in an intuitive manner, through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, AIA can significantly reduce the amount of time spent on retrieving saved information for each client that might have been saved on many different sources previously.

This user guide offers the following to insurance agents or other users trying to learn how to use the application:
- A quick start to running the application
- All available features
- Examples on how to use each feature

### Use of in-text formatting
Bold words refer to commands to be performed by users.

e.g. **cd** will refer to the "change directory" command in CLI.


Words in quotations are files, file types or dependencies.

e.g. "exe" refers to the executable file type used on windows.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Markup words in `UPPER_CASE` are the information to be entered by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is an information which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Client` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Client`, `t/Client t/PremiumMember` etc.

* User input can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If an input is expected only once in for a specific command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the input will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Dates should be in "YYYY-MM-DD" format, unless stated otherwise. Single digits should be zero padded.<br>
  e.g. `2022-05-17`, `2021-01-01` and `2011-10-10` are in the correct format, while `2022-5-17` and `2021-1-1` are in the wrong format.
* `INDEX` used in the different commands refer to the index number shown in the displayed person list.

  ❗The `INDEX` must be a positive integer i.e. 1,2,3,...

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding a contact: `add`

When you meet a new potential client and you managed to get their contact information, you can `add` them as a contact in the application.

* Upon adding a person, a default recently interacted date and description would be automatically generated.
  * The default date would be the day the contact was added, and default description would be "First Interaction".

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS b/BIRTH_DATE [t/TAG]…​`
* `BIRTH_DATE` should be in the specified date format.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb:
**Tip:**
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/1970-01-01` adds the contact with only the compulsory information provided.
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/1970-01-01 t/Client t/BasicMember` adds the contact with the compulsory information provided and the optional information.

### Viewing all contacts: `list`

When you want to look through your whole clientele, `list` will show all the people saved in the application.

Format: `list`

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing a contact: `edit`

If you realise you need to change a client's outdated information, you can `edit` an existing contact in the application.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [b/BIRTH_DATE]
[t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
  specifying any tags after it.
* `BIRTH_DATE` should be in the specified date format.

Examples:
* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Finding contacts by name: `find`

Scrolling through a whole list of people to find a specific client takes a long time. Instead, you can `find` people using keywords of their name.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Deleting a contact: `delete`

If a contact entry is no longer relevant, you can `delete` the specified contact from the application.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd contact in the application.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st contact in the results of the `find` command.

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Adding a tag: `tag`

Suppose you want to catalogue a contact with a specific category like "client", you can `tag` the contact to a category, as specified by the index.

Format: `tag INDEX t/TAG`

Example:
* `tag 27 t/client` adds the "client" tag to the 27th contact in the display contact list.

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Deleting a tag: `untag`

If a contact is no longer a client, and you wish to remove the tag, you can simply `untag` contact from the cateogory, as specified by the index.

Format: `untag INDEX t/TAG`

Example:
* `untag 27 t/client` deletes the "client" tag from the 27th contact in the display contact list.

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Example:
* `#client` finds all the contacts that are tagged to "client".

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Adding interaction records with a contact: `log`

After meeting a client, you might want to write a note about the client, along with the meeting date. By using the `log` command, you can manually save your interaction with the person in the form of a note accompanied by a date.

Format: `log INDEX d/DATE des/description`
* `DATE` should be in the specified date format.

Example:

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Deleting a recent interaction record with a contact: `unlog`

Suppose you made a mistake while recording your interaction. You can easily `unlog` the saved interaction record from the specified contact.

Format: `unlog INDEX del/INDEX`

* `INDEX` signifies the specified contact.
* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact list.
* `del/INDEX` signifies the interaction record to delete.
* `del/INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the contact's displayed list of interaction records.

Occasionally, it might be hard to remember if you met someone recently. The `within` command allows you to show all contacts that you had interacted with within a specified range of days.

Format: `within DAYS`
* DAYS must be a positive integer.

Example:
* `within 12` shows a list of people that were last contacted within the past 12 days.

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Example:
* `after 50` shows a list of people that were last contacted more than 50 days ago.

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact list.

Format: `remind INDEX r/REMINDER rd/DATE`
* `DATE` should be in the specified date format.

Example:

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Deleting a reminder: `forget`

If a reminder is no longer necessary, you can delete the specific reminder to make your reminder list cleaner and shorter.
